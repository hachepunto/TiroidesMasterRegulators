### Overview

This repository contains all scripts, helper functions, and reproducible pipelines used in the manuscript:

"Two Cohorts, One Network: Consensus Master Regulators Orchestrating Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma"

The analysis integrates transcriptomic data from two independent cohorts — TCGA-THCA (RNA-seq) and GEO GSE33630 (microarray) — to identify Transcriptional Master Regulators (TMRs) using a unified VIPER-based network approach.The pipeline covers normalization, differential expression, regulon inference with ARACNe-AP, and meta-analysis of master regulators and hallmark enrichments.
